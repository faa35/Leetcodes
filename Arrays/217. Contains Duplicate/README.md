```python
class Solution(object):
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        seen = []  # List to track seen elements

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in seen:  # Check if the value is already in the seen list
                return True
            seen.append(nums[i])  # Add the value to the seen list
        return False  # Return False if no duplicates are found
```

### Improvements:
While the corrected code works, using a list (`seen`) makes the lookup operation \(O(n)\), resulting in an overall time complexity of \(O(n^2)\). A better approach would be to use a `set` for `seen`, as set lookups are \(O(1)\).

### Optimized Code:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        seen = set()  # Use a set for better performance

        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:  # Check if the number is already in the set
                return True
            seen.add(num)  # Add the number to the set
        return False  # Return False if no duplicates are found
```

### Explanation:
1. A `set` is used instead of a list, as it allows constant-time lookups.
2. The `for` loop iterates over the elements in `nums`, and each element is checked against the `set`.
3. If a duplicate is found, the function immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, after the loop completes, it returns `False`.

### Complexity of Optimized Code:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for storing elements in the `set`.
